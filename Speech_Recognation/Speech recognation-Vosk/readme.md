## Inference from Vosk

### This task is about: Develope a speech recognition tool for Persian language.
### In this task we use models of Kaldi and Vosk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Brief  Code explanation:
" I did this project in google colab, So you can run this in google colab"
At first inistalling VOSK, Next I chose the "[vosk-model-fa-0.5](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/)" model frome VOSK models.(It is about Persian language ASR model)\
for using this model we need audio that it is about speech in Persian, So for doing this part I should use [Recourding audio from microphone](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ricardodeazambuja/03ac98c31e87caf284f7b06286ebf7fd/microphone-to-numpy-array-from-your-browser-in-colab.ipynb) part.
After voice recording, the vosk model will start to recognition.
